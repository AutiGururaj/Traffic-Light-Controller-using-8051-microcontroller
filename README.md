# Traffic-Light-Controller-using-8051-microcontroller
Simulated a traffic light sequence in Proteus software, meticulously managing timing and transitions to accurately replicate real-world operation. Ensured synchronization of light changes to meet predefined intervals, contributing to an understanding of automated signal control systems and timing accuracy in embedded systems simulation.
